#### Properties 
* Orthogonality is **symmetric**: If $\mathbf{x}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{y}$, then $\mathbf{y}$ is also orthogonal to $\mathbf{x}$. 

* The zero vector $\mathbf{0}$ is orthogonal to every vector in $V$. 

* If a set of orthonormal vectors forms a **basis** for $V$, then every vector in $V$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of those basis vectors.

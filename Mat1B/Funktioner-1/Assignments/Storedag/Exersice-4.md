#### Answer
The solution for $f(10)$ is 11 as that is the closes prime number that is larger than 10. For $f(13)$ the solution is 17.

#### Answer
**existence (eksistens)**
As there is a infinite amount of prime numbers as noted by Euclid's theorem, then there must always be a prime that is larger than any given number.

**uniqueness (entydighed)**
For any number n there exists one unique lowest prime number that is larger than n.

The function is therefore well-defined, as there always exists a next prime larger than n (existence) and as there is only one smallest prime number larger than n (uniqueness).

#### Answer
There is no known mathematical formular for finding the prime number larger than a given number n. This is because prime numbers don't follow a simple mathematical connection, therefore you have to find the number via an algorithm.

* If all elements in B is hit by an element from A, $f(A)=B$ then it it called a surjective (surjektiv) function.

* If for all $x_1,x_2 \in A$, then it counts that: $x_1 \neq x_2 \implies f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ then the function is called injective (injektiv).

* If f is both surjective and injective it is called bijective (bijektiv).

### E.g.
$$
f(x_1,x_2) = ln(4-x_1^2-x_2^2)
$$
**What is the domain for this function?**

To determine the domain (differensmængden) of the function we need to ensure that the argument of the logarithm is positive. That is, we require:
$$
4 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 > 0
$$
Rearranging the inequality gives
$$
x_1^2​+x_2^2​<4.
$$
This inequality describes the interior of a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin in the $x_1x_2​-plane.$

Thus, the domain of $f$ is:
$$
\{(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1^2+x_2^2<4\}
$$

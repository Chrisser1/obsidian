## ##  Colligative Properties: Boiling Point Elevation

**colligative properties**. These are properties of solutions that depend on the concentration of solute particles, but not on their identity. One of the key colligative properties is **boiling point elevation**.

When you add a non-volatile solute, like sodium chloride (NaCl), to a solvent, like water, the solute particles get in the way of the water molecules trying to escape into the gas phase. This lowers the solution's vapor pressure.

Because the vapor pressure is lower, you need to add more energy (increase the temperature to a higher point) to get the vapor pressure to equal the atmospheric pressure, which is the definition of the boiling point. Therefore, the boiling point of the salt water solution will be higher than that of pure water.

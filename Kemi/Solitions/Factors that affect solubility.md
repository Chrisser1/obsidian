## Solvent vs. Solute
In any solution, the components are identified as follows:

* **Solvent:** The substance that is present in the **largest amount**. It's the medium in which the other components are dissolved.

* **Solute:** The substance(s) present in **smaller amounts** that are dissolved in the solvent.

## Analysis of Ringer's Lactate

1. The problem states that Ringer's lactate is an **"aqueous solution."** The term "aqueous" literally means "of or containing water," which immediately identifies **water** as the solvent.

2. The other components are all listed with very small percentages (0.72%, 0.037%, etc.). Since they are dissolved in the water, they are the **solutes**.

- **Paramagnetic** atoms have at least **one unpaired electron**. The magnetic fields from these unpaired electrons cause the atom to be weakly attracted to an external magnetic field.
    
- **Diamagnetic** atoms have **all of their electrons paired** (one spinning up ↑, one spinning down ↓). The magnetic fields cancel out, and the atom is weakly repelled by an external magnetic field.

The Lewis definition of acids and bases is based on the sharing of electron pairs:

- **Lewis Acid:** An **electron-pair acceptor**. These molecules are typically electron-deficient, often having a central atom with an incomplete octet.
    
- **Lewis Base:** An **electron-pair donor**. These molecules must have at least one lone pair of electrons to donate.

### Example
#### Analysis of the Compounds

- **BH₃ (Borane):** The central boron atom has only 6 valence electrons (3 from B, 3 from the bonds to H). This **incomplete octet** means it has an empty orbital and can accept a pair of electrons, making it a classic **Lewis acid**.
    
- **PH₃ (Phosphine):** The central phosphorus atom has a complete octet and a **lone pair of electrons**, which it can donate. This makes it a **Lewis base**.
    
- **CH₃OH (Methanol):** The oxygen atom in methanol has **two lone pairs of electrons** that it can donate. This makes it a **Lewis base**.
    
- **NH₃ (Ammonia):** The central nitrogen atom has a complete octet and a **lone pair of electrons**, which it can donate. This makes it a classic **Lewis base**.

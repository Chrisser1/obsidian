### What is a Disproportionation Reaction?

A disproportionation reaction is a type of redox reaction where a **single reactant is simultaneously oxidized and reduced**. This means an element in an intermediate oxidation state is converted into products where it has both a higher and a lower oxidation state.

### Analysis of the Correct Equation

Let's look at the oxidation states of nickel (Ni) in the correct reaction:

- **Reactant:** In Ni+, the oxidation state is **+1**.
    
- **Products:**
    
    - In Ni2+, the oxidation state has increased to **+2**. This is **oxidation** (loss of an electron).
        
    - In Ni(s), the elemental form, the oxidation state has decreased to **0**. This is **reduction** (gain of an electron).
        

Since the reactant Ni+ is converted into both a more oxidized form (Ni2+) and a more reduced form (Ni(s)), it has undergone disproportionation.

## Concentration cells
A concentration cell is a specific type of **voltaic (galvanic) cell** where the two half-cells are constructed from **identical components** but differ in the **concentration** of the electrolytes.

The voltage is generated not by a difference in the chemical nature of the electrodes, but by the natural tendency for the differing concentrations to equalize. Electrons flow from the less concentrated half-cell (the anode) to the more concentrated half-cell (the cathode) to balance the concentrations.

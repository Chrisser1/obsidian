This calculation relies on one key piece of information and one principle of battery construction.

1. **Voltage per Cell:** A single lead-acid cell produces a potential of approximately **2.0 V**.
    
2. **Series Connection:** In a battery, cells are connected in series to achieve a higher total voltage. When connected in series, the voltages of the individual cells add up.

Corrosion (like rusting) is an electrochemical process where a metal is oxidized. The methods to prevent it are designed to stop this process.

- **Galvanization:** This is the process of coating a metal, like iron, with a layer of a more reactive metal, like zinc. The zinc acts as a physical barrier and also corrodes first, protecting the iron underneath. * **Cathodic Protection:** This is a general technique where the metal you want to protect is forced to be the **cathode** (the site of reduction, not corrosion) of an electrochemical cell.
    
- **Sacrificial Anode:** This is a common method of cathodic protection. A more reactive metal (the sacrificial anode) is electrically connected to the metal being protected. The sacrificial anode corrodes, or "sacrifices" itself, while the main structure remains safe. This is often used on ship hulls and pipelines.

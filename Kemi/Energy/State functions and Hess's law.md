## State functions
* `State functions` a property that depends only on the current state, not the past properties of a system.

* `Heat and work` is not state functions

## Hess's law
* If a reaction takes place in several steps, the overall enthalpy change, $\Delta H$, is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps.
### Example

## Using Hess's law
1. Change the coefficients. $\Delta H$ changes by the same factor.
2. Reverse the direction. $\Delta H$ reverses sign.
3.  Cancel intermediates

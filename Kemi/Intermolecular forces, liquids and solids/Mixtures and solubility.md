# Solubility & Miscibility — MCQ Solver

**Core idea:** “Like dissolves like.” Match intermolecular forces (polarity, H-bonding). Ionic compounds follow water-solubility rules.

## 1) Classify the players
- **Ionic?** Use water/polar-protic solvents; apply standard solubility rules (nitrates, Group-1, NH4+ usually soluble).
- **Covalent:** tag each as **nonpolar**, **polar aprotic** (polar but no O–H/N–H donors), or **polar protic** (has O–H/N–H; H-bond donor).
- **Hydrogen bonding:** donors (O–H, N–H) mix well with donors/acceptors; non-H-bonding liquids prefer each other.

## 2) Quick decision
- **Ionic solute?** → water/polar-protic (unless a special complexing agent is given).
- **Two liquids?**
  - Same class (nonpolar↔nonpolar, polar-aprotic↔polar-aprotic, etc.) → likely miscible.
  - Large polarity gap → immiscible or limited solubility.
  - If unsure → check a miscibility chart.

## 3) Handful of reference values (≈25 °C)
*(Closer numbers → more likely to mix. ε = dielectric constant; P′ = Snyder polarity index)*

| Solvent | Class | ε | P′ | H-bond donor |
|---|---|---:|---:|:--:|
| Water | polar protic | ~78 | 10.2 | Yes |
| Acetone | polar aprotic | ~20.7 | 5.1 | No |
| Ethyl acetate | polar aprotic | ~6.0 | 4.4 | No |
| Benzene | nonpolar (aromatic) | ~2.3 | ~2.3 | No |
| Hexane | nonpolar (alkane) | ~1.9 | ~0.0–0.1 | No |
| Octane | nonpolar (alkane) | ~2.0 | ~0.0–0.1 | No |

## 4) Mini-examples (pattern you can reuse)

**A. “Which dissolves in octane (C₈H₁₈)?”**  
Pick a **nonpolar** solute (e.g., CCl₄). Polar/ionic choices (water, KNO₃, small alcohols) won’t.

**B. “Which solvent is miscible with ethyl acetate?”**  
EtOAc is **moderately polar aprotic**; it’s miscible with many organics. Safe single-pick logic: **acetone** (closest polarity). Miscibility tables also show mixing with **benzene** and **hexane** (and typically with higher alkanes, e.g., octane).

## 5) Fast checklist for MCQs
- [ ] Ionic vs covalent identified  
- [ ] For covalent: label as nonpolar / polar-aprotic / polar-protic  
- [ ] Compare ε or P′; pick closest  
- [ ] Consider H-bonding (donor/acceptor match)  
- [ ] If two-liquid uncertainty remains → consult a miscibility table

### Handy lookups (keep nearby)
- **Miscibility tables**: general solvent–solvent grids  
- **Dielectric constants (ε)**: compiled solvent lists  
- **Polarity index (P′)**: Snyder tables  
- **Protic vs aprotic definitions**: short organic-chem primers  
- **Solubility rules in water**: standard general-chem summary

## Ditergents and micelles
* `micelle` a spherical assembly of molecules or polyatomic ions containing polar heads on nonpolar tails.

* `Condenced phases` solid and liquid
* `Intermolecular forces`the forces that occur between molecules:
	* Dipole-dipole interactions
	* hydrogen bonds
	* London dispersion forces

## Dipole-dipole interactions
* attraction between polar covalent molecules
* They tend to stick to each other

## Hydrogen bonding
* `Hydrogen bond`a strong intermolecular force between molecules containing H-F, H-O or H-N bonds. (e.g. water)

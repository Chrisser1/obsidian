* Usually solids
* `malleable`can easily be shaped
* `ductile`meaning they can be stretched into wire
* Oxidized to form metal cations

## Metallic character and periodic trends

## Crystal packing
* Metals pack together in close-packed arrangements
* Not as rigid

## Atomic radii
* Generally larger on the right and increase going down

* Metal cations are much smaller that the neutral atoms

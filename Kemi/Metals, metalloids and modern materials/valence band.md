The valence band is the energy band in a solid material that contains the electrons with the highest energy.

Band theory explains that the discrete energy levels of isolated atoms merge into continuous ranges of allowed energies, called energy bands, when atoms form a solid. The ranges of energy forbidden for electrons are band gaps. This model classifies materials as conductors, semiconductors, or insulators by the relative positions and gaps between their `valence bands` (outermost filled bands) and `conduction bands` (available for conduction).

In band theory, the conduction band is a range of electron energy levels in a solid where electrons are free to move and con[[Properties of coordination complexes]]duct electricity.

The electrical properties of a solid are explained by **band theory**, which describes how electrons are arranged in energy bands.

- **Valence Band**: The outermost energy band filled with electrons.
    
- **Conduction Band**: The next higher energy band, which is empty. Electrons in this band are free to move and conduct electricity.
    
- **Band Gap**: The energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band.
    

The size of the band gap determines whether a material can conduct electricity:

- **Insulators**: Have a **large band gap**. A large amount of energy is needed for electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band, so they don't conduct electricity.
    
- **Semiconductors**: Have a **small band gap**. A small input of energy can excite electrons into the conduction band, allowing for some conductivity.
    
- **Conductors**: Have **no band gap**. The valence and conduction bands overlap, allowing electrons to move freely into the conduction band with virtually no energy input.

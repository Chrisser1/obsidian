The valence band is the energy band in a solid material that contains the electrons with the highest energy.

Band theory explains that the discrete energy levels of isolated atoms merge into continuous ranges of allowed energies, called energy bands, when atoms form a solid. The ranges of energy forbidden for electrons are band gaps. This model classifies materials as conductors, semiconductors, or insulators by the relative positions and gaps between their `valence bands` (outermost filled bands) and `conduction bands` (available for conduction).

In band theory, the conduction band is a range of electron energy levels in a solid where electrons are free to move and conduct electricity.

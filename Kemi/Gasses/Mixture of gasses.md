When dealing with ideal gasses:
* P, V depend on the amount of gas present, not its identity
## Partial pressure
The pressure caused by one gas in a mixture. Adding up all the partial pressures gives the total pressure:
$$
P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + \dots + P_n
$$
We also have
$$
\frac{P_i}{P_{total}} = \frac{n_i}{n_{total}}
$$
* $P_i$ is the pressure of one gas
* $P_{total}$ is the total pressure
* $n_i$ is the moles of one component
* $n_{total}$ is the total moles

### Mole fraction
The number of moles of one component in a mixture divided by the total number of moles present.
$$
\chi_i = \frac{n_i}{n_{total}}
$$

We can now write everything as:
$$
P_i = X_iP_{total}
$$

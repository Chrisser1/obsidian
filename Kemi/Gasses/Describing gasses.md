1. Gasses do not have a defined shape or volume
2. In a gas the particles are spaced far apart
	1. Very little interaction with the between each other
	2. Travel in straight line until bounce
3. The lowest temperature is the absolute zero of -273.15 degree Celsius

$$
pressure = \frac{force}{area}
$$

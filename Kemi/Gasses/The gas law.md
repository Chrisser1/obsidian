The mathematical relationships between the temperature, pressure,, volume and quantity of a gas.

## Boyle's law
Describes the pressure and the volume of a gas are inversely related
* If the volume goes up the the pressure goes down and vise versa
$$
PV = constant
$$
This means we can relate changes to each other via
$$
P_1V_1 = P_2V_2
$$
### Example


## Charles's law
At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature.
* If the temperature increases so does the volume
$$
V \propto T
$$
$$
\frac{V}{T} = constant
$$
This also means that
$$
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
$$
For gas problems, the temperature $T$ must be in kelvins.

## The combined gas law
$$
\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}
$$

## Avogadro's law
If temperature and pressure are constant, the volume of gas is proportional to the number of moles of gas present.
$$
V \propto n
$$
* Standard temperature and pressure (STP)
	* $T = 0 \degree C (273.15 K)$
	* $P = 1 bar (0.987 atm)$
* At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.7 L
* At 298 K and 1 atm, 1 mole of gas occupies 24.5 L

## Van der waals equation
$$
	P = \frac{RT}{V-b} - \frac{a}{V^2}

**Dehydration** means the removal of a water molecule (H2​O). In an alcohol dehydration reaction, the hydroxyl group (–OH) is removed from one carbon atom, and a hydrogen atom (–H) is removed from an adjacent carbon atom.

To satisfy the valency of the carbon atoms, a new bond is formed between them, resulting in a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**. The functional group characterized by a C=C double bond is an **alkene**.

## Example

- **Identify Reactant and Product**: The starting material is **2-heptyne**, an alkyne which contains a carbon-carbon triple bond (C≡C). The final product is **heptane**, an alkane which contains only carbon-carbon single bonds (C−C).
    
- **Analyze the Transformation**: To convert a triple bond into a single bond, you must add a total of four hydrogen atoms to the two carbons that form the triple bond. This process is called **hydrogenation**.
    
- **Required Reagents**: The hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane requires **hydrogen gas (H2​)** and a metal catalyst (such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), or nickel (Ni)). Using **excess** H2​ ensures that the reaction proceeds all the way to the alkane, rather than stopping at the intermediate alkene stage.

The correct monomer is **isoprene**, which has the structure shown in the first option.

### Explanation

1. **Identify the Reaction Type**: The question states this is an **addition polymerization**. In this type of reaction, monomer units add to one another in such a way that the polymer contains all the atoms of the monomer unit. This process typically involves the rearrangement of double bonds.
    
2. **Analyze the Polymer's Repeating Unit**: The structure of polyisoprene shows a repeating four-carbon chain with a double bond in the middle: `-[CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₂]-`.
    
3. **Reverse the Polymerization**: To find the original monomer, we must reverse the process. The formation of this polymer from a conjugated diene (a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond) involves a **1,4-addition**. The double bonds at the ends of the monomer open up to form new single bonds that link the units, and a new double bond forms in the middle of what was the monomer. To find the monomer, we reverse this:
    
    - Break the double bond in the middle of the repeating unit: `-C=C-` becomes `-C-C-`.
        
    - Form new double bonds at the ends of the four-carbon unit: `CH₂=C` and `C=CH₂`.
        
    
    Applying this to the repeating unit `CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₂` gives the monomer **H2​C=C(CH3​)−CH=CH2​**.
    
4. **Identify the Monomer**: This molecule is named **2-methyl-1,3-butadiene**, commonly known as **isoprene**. This matches the first option.

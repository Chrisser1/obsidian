**Dehydration** means the removal of a water molecule (H2​O). In an alcohol dehydration reaction, the hydroxyl group (–OH) is removed from one carbon atom, and a hydrogen atom (–H) is removed from an adjacent carbon atom.

To satisfy the valency of the carbon atoms, a new bond is formed between them, resulting in a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**. The functional group characterized by a C=C double bond is an **alkene**.

- **Identify Reactant and Product**: The starting material is **2-heptyne**, an alkyne which contains a carbon-carbon triple bond (C≡C). The final product is **heptane**, an alkane which contains only carbon-carbon single bonds (C−C).
    
- **Analyze the Transformation**: To convert a triple bond into a single bond, you must add a total of four hydrogen atoms to the two carbons that form the triple bond. This process is called **hydrogenation**.
    
- **Required Reagents**: The hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkane requires **hydrogen gas (H2​)** and a metal catalyst (such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), or nickel (Ni)). Using **excess** H2​ ensures that the reaction proceeds all the way to the alkane, rather than stopping at the intermediate alkene stage.

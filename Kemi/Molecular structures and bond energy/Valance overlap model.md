## How to Count Sigma Bonds

The rule for counting sigma bonds from a Lewis structure is straightforward:

- Every **single bond** contains 1 σ bond.
    
- Every **double bond** contains 1 σ bond and 1 pi (π) bond.
    
- Every **triple bond** contains 1 σ bond and 2 pi (π) bonds.
    

Essentially, **every bond connection** you see between two atoms contains exactly **one** sigma bond. To find the total, we just need to count all the connections.

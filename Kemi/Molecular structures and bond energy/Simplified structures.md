1. Each vertex and each endpoint represents a single carbon.
2. The hydrogen bonded to carbon are not drawn.
3. Double and triple bonds are represented by double and triple lines.
4. Atoms other than carbon and hydrogen are labeled with their label
5. Hydrogen bonded to atoms other than carbon are shown as condensed structures
